Arch users can install fbmessenger through the AUR, using the package named
"fbmessenger-git". See https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fbmessenger-git/

To build the package here, just run:

  makepkg

Note that this will pull down fresh sources from GitHub, rather than using
local sources. To build with local changes, do something like this:

  mkdir src ; ln -s ../../../ src/fbmessenger ; makepkg -e
