To create a .deb package for Debian/Ubuntu/etc, just run:

  ./build-deb.sh

That will create a package named something like "fbmessenger-0.2.0.deb" in the
current directory. To install it, run:

  sudo dpkg -i fbmessenger-0.2.0.deb

The package manager will probably complain that you're missing some
dependencies. To fix that, run:

  sudo apt-get install -f

Now you should be good to go. The app should show up in your desktop
environment, or you can launch it with:

  fbmessenger
