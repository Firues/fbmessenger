To install on Mac OS X, you'll want to use Homebrew. http://brew.sh/

If you don't already have it, install it from their site. The instructions will
tell you to run something like this:

  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Now you can install fbmessenger and it's dependencies. This step will take
several minutes. Note that python3 won't get installed automatically for you
(not sure why), so you have to install it explicitly first:

  brew install python3 && brew install ./fbmessenger.rb

Now you can launch fbmessenger from the command line:

  fbmessenger
